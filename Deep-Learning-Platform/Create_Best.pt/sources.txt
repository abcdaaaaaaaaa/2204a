The architecture of Reference 1 was used when creating the deep learning architecture. At the same time, in the animal data set process, all of Reference 3 and the first 3 animals from Reference 4 were marked with the labelimg program (Reference 6), making a total of 83 animal classes.

When using the data set in Reference 3, the labels files were created from scratch and the file names were changed to be regular from rename_files.py.

When using the data set in Reference 4, classes with 2 and more than 2 names were renamed and the labels files was updated accordingly. Then, the class numbers using the coco.py code to natural numbers, again labels files was updated and the file names were changed to be regular from rename_files.py.

Yolov7-e6e.pt (Reference: 1 and 2) was used in the training process and the epochs value was determined as 150 and Google Colab (Reference 5) was used during the training process.
